<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields
    (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is an object's
    procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self").
    In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2] OOP languages are diverse, but the most
    popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.</p>

<p>Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming
    to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming. Significant object-oriented languages include Java,
    C++, C#, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, Object Pascal, Objective-C, Dart, Swift, Scala, Common Lisp, MATLAB, and Smalltalk.</p>
